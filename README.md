## Introduction
I came across this dataset on the forage website provided by JP Morgan Chase & Co. It contains a dataset for a commodity storage contract. 
The dataset contains Natural gas dataset which contains date and prices. 

### Skills demonstrated 
1.	How to extrapolate data for granular insights.
2.	Knowledge of machine learning, statistical models and data analysis.
3.	Using machine learning for validation, testing and data modelling.
4.	using available data to predict customer trends and actions 

### Data Transformation 
For task 1, using data available we were able to create a price estimation function to predict past and future prices. We also transformed the data using bilinear regression to account for seasonality. In task 2 we transformed the data to create a price create a price contact function that calculate the profit or loss for undertaking a contract of buying, storing and selling of natural gas. In task 3, we trained the data to look for the probability of defaulting on a contract.

### Conclusion and recommendation 
Logistic regression is the best possible model to train for the probability of default has it has the highest accuracy with the lowest relative ratio of false negatives and positive values compared to other models. 
Log-likelihood also provides a better look at our dataset.
